Sparky is a stand-alone bash script. 
The rest of the files in this directories are for examples only,
and are not required for sparky to function.

To test sparky, start it running with:

./sparky

Now leave it running while you edit ./sparkup/index.spark

As soon as you've made your changes, save the file, and watch
the output from sparky as it dutifully updates the output file
located in ./html/index.html

Cool, eh?
