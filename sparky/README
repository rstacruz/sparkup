Sparky is a stand-alone Sparkup compiler written in bash script.

The rest of the files in this directory are for examples only,
and are not required for Sparky to function.

To test sparky, start it running with:

./sparky

Now leave it running while you edit ./sparkup/index.spark

As soon as you've made your changes, save the file, and watch
the output from Sparky as it dutifully updates the destination 
files located in ./html/

e.g. ./sparkup/index.spark compiles to ./html/index.html

Cool, eh?
